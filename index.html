        <h1>How to Stop Checking your Phone all the Time</h1>
        <p>“Do more things that make you forget about checking your phone,” they say. <br>
          I often find myself mindlessly scrolling Facebook though initially, I took my phone only to check the weather. Sometimes I grab my phone without any reason at all. Everyone around me is doing the same. <br>
          An average smartphone owner  47 times per day. 85% of users do this even while talking to their friends and family. </p>

      <p>Fortunately, I don’t keep up with this trend. On average, I spend 25-35 minutes per day on my iPhone. Though sometimes I find myself diving into that phone checking loop, most of the time I can control it. Here are the tips that help me use my smartphone less and avoid phone addiction.</p>

        <h1>Pause to think before picking up your phone</h1>
        <p>Every time you're about to unlock your phone, take a moment to think about why you are doing this right now. Do you need to perform a particular task like scanning a document or texting your boss? Then, fulfill this task and put your phone away.</p>

        <h1>Analyze how you use your phone and set limits</h1>
        <p>With iOS 12, Apple has introduced the Screen Time feature which shows how much time you spend on your phone, what apps you use the most, and how often do you pick up your device. To see the report, go to Settings > Screen Time.</p>

        <h1>Get rid of distracting apps</h1>
        <p>Sometimes you just can’t resist tapping a colorful icon on the Home screen. This is usually the case for games and social media apps. How can one avoid this temptation? Move all addictive apps to the second page where it’s harder to open them spontaneously. </p>

        <h1>Minimize notifications</h1>
        <p>When a new app asks if it can send me notifications, I usually say, ”No.” I only turn on notifications for messaging apps and email. If your app has flexible notification options, it’s a good idea to play around with them. </p>

        <h1>Keep your phone literally away</h1>
        <p>It’s easier to forget about checking your phone when it’s physically out of sight and reach. After coming home, I just leave the phone in my bag and put it in the cupboard. Nothing terrible ever happens. </p>

        <h1>Don’t use your phone before going to bed</h1>
        <p>I try to ditch my phone at least a couple of hours before going to bed. It hurts when I break this rule. After my last spontaneous googling session at 12 AM, I was just lying in my bed for a couple of hours staying alert and unable to fall asleep.</p>
